# Welcome to the readme.md of petHotel (I hope is well explained, in case not you can ask me anything)

## To Get Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### - What is the project about

Some accommodations for pets are not properly equipped and can be very expensive, taking our pet on a trip is not always possible, this is something very important for our pets if we want them to be comfortable while we are traveling. Pet Hotel is an App made for the well-being of our friends when we are not with them.

This application is useful for pet owners and pet lovers who can cover all their needs while you are not with them. Pet Hotel, the pet accommodation App works as a tool to find the best place for your pet to stay.

Some features already used are a list of both pet owners and hosts that you can get by clicking the link in the navbar "Host" and "Owner" respectively.

### - Tech stack (KEY TECHNOLOGIES)

    - VS Code (of course)
    - Express and Node.js (used to build the backend)
    - React.js and React Router (used to build the front end)
    - MySQL (used to build the database)
    - Bootstrap (for styling)

### - Future features

- Able to sign in / log in as pet owner or host (authentication component)
- Able to connect pet owners and hosts (this could be a chat, or an email notification)
- Able to add reviews to both of them (a table for this is already created in the database with no default data yet)
- CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE METHOD (BackEnd) -> Post method is created already for pet owners and hosts, you can already post a new host, for posting a pet owner you will need to edit the form to ask for more items (you will notice in the tables that a FK is needed for this matter)
- APIs for location and maps (or whatever other API's you decide)
- Filter and sort by options
